#  Energy Management PV – Cogeneration – Thermal Storage

### Task: Optimization of the System (Cost Minimization)
> Scenario 1: Formulation of an optimal strategy for minimization of operation costs. Assumption of a feed-in tariff of 10 cent/kWh for cogeneration and PV and 
for buying electricity of 25 cent/kWh.

> Scenario 2: As it is more profitable to consume PV on site an electric heater with a variable thermal power from 10 to 20 kW is integrated (efficiency 95%).
Influence on the strategy and the contribution to profit.

### System Components and Dimensioning
#### Photovoltaic:
20kW

#### Thermal system:
* CHP: power 30..60 kWel, ηel = 35%, ηth = 55%
* auxiliary boiler: power: 20...200kWth, ηth = 90%
* thermal storage: capacity: 200 kWh, losses 2%/h
* thermal load profile: from attached data (_DHW_HTG_Pel_Psol_exp_update.xlsx_)
* Electric load profile: from attached data (_DHW_HTG_Pel_Psol_exp_update.xlsx_)
