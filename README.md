#  Energy Management PV – Cogeneration – Thermal Storage

### Task: Optimization of the system
> Scenario 1: Formulation of an optimal strategy for minimization of operation costs. Assumption of a feed-in tariff of 10 cent/kWh for cogeneration and PV and 
for buying electricity of 25 cent/kWh.

> Scenario 2: As it is more profitable to consume PV on site an electric heater with a variable thermal power from 10 to 20 kW is integrated (efficiency 95%).
Influence on the strategy and the contribution to profit.
